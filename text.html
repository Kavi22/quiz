        <p>The very last kick of the clásico could not have been more perfectly executed nor more dramatically delivered, Lionel Messi guiding the ball inside the post to take his team top. It was the      500th goal of his career and few have been more significant. It prompted Luis Enrique to say: “He is the best player in history.”</p>

        <p>Just when it seemed all was lost there may be life in La Liga; there is life in Barcelona too. With five games to go they are leaders on their head-to-head record and, although <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/realmadrid" title="OOPS">Real Madrid</a> have a game in hand and Zinedine Zidane rightly says “we still depend on ourselves,” nothing feels impossible now.</p>

        <p>Thirty seconds earlier it had done. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona">Barcelona</a> thought they had been denied. There was a kind of crushing inevitability about the way James Rodríguez scored with five minutes to go. His goal made it 2-2, a scoreline that, had it stood, would have all but clinched the title, and in an appropriate way. This was a portrait of Madrid this season, a late goal from a substitute, another comeback, fans erupting in joy, Madrid, down to 10 men after Sergio Ramos’s 77th-minute red card, doing it again. </p>

        <p>Thirty seconds earlier it had done. Barcelona thought they had been denied. There was a kind of crushing inevitability about the way James Rodríguez scored with five minutes to go. His goal made it 2-2, a scoreline that, had it stood, would have all but clinched the title, and in an appropriate way. This was a portrait of Madrid this season, a late goal from a substitute, another comeback, fans erupting in joy, Madrid, down to 10 men after Sergio Ramos’s 77th-minute red card, doing it again.</p>

       <p>Madrid went straight at Barcelona and they were appealing for a penalty after 91 seconds, when Cristiano Ronaldo was caught by Samuel Umtiti, and that proved just the start of a breathless game. Two teams went for each other and it was hard to keep up, so much was happening.</p>

       <p>Just listing the shots could fill a page: Ronaldo, Andrés Iniesta, Luis Suárez twice, Ronaldo again, Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale, all inside 20 minutes. Marc-André Ter Stegen and Keylor Navas started making saves early and were not about to stop. The game was not half an hour old when Madrid got the opener, Ter Stegen punching out a corner that Marcelo turned back in for Ramos to nudge against the post before Casemiro followed up.</p>

       <p>Thirty minutes had only just passed when the lead was gone again. Suárez let Sergio Busquets’ pass run through his legs and Messi, dashing through the middle from deep where he had taken hold of the game, stepped beyond Luka Modric and Dani Carvajal and struck under Navas. Three sharp, smooth touches taken with a bandage still in his mouth – there since Marcelo had caught him with an elbow.</p>
